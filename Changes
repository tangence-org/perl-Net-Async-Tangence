Revision history for Net-Async-Tangence

0.11    CHANGES:
         * ->socketpair is now in IO::Async::OS not $loop

0.10    CHANGES:
         * Rewrite unit tests for Tangence 0.17
         * Version-guard binary protocol-dependent unit tests so they degrade
           gracefully in future

0.09    CHANGES:
         * Renamed ssh:// URL scheme to sshexec://
         * Added sshunix:// URL scheme that allows directly connecting to a
           UNIX socket on the server

0.08    CHANGES:
         * Renamed Net::Async::Tangence::Client->connect to ->connect_url so
           it doesn't collide with IO::Async::Protocol's method
         * More unit testing

         * Updated for Tangence 0.06; provide tanfiles instead of in-source

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Split modules out from base Tangence distribution
